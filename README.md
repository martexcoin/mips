# MarteX Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

MIP stands for MarteX Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), a MIP is a design document providing information to the MarteX community, or describing a new feature for MarteX or its processes or environment. The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

Because MarteX is forked from the Bitcoin and Dashcoin codebase, many of the BIPs and DIPs can be applied to MarteX. The purpose of the MIPs is not to duplicate those which exist as BIPs or DIPs, but to introduce protocol upgrades or feature specifications which are unique to MarteX.


## Contributions

We use the same general guidelines for introducing a new MIP as specified in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), with a few differences. Specifically:

* Before you propose some MIP, you must readme these two links: [Principles-of-MarteXcoin](./MarteXcoin-philosophy/Principles-of-MarteXcoin.mediawiki), [Prohibited-changes](./MarteXcoin-philosophy/Prohibited-changes.mediawiki).
* After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by posting about the new idea to the [MarteXcoin Developer and MIPs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/martexcoin-developers-and-mips).
* Instead of the BIP editor, initiate contact with the MarteX Core development team and your request should be routed to the MIP editor(s). The MIP workflow mimics the BIP workflow.
* Recommended licenses include the MIT license
* Markdown format is the preferred format for MIPs
* Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the MIPs git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP/DIP/MIP style as described in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), and named with an alias such as "mip-johndoe-infinitemartex" until the editor has assigned it a MIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign MIP numbers).
